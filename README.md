# Full-Stack Development Lab 5 Demo

## CI/CD Demonstration using Azure Resources and Docker Hub

This lab is a simple out-of-the-box Spring Boot Web App that has been uploaded to a Docker Hub repo and connected to a Azure web resource.

By making changes to the project, any commits will build the project and deploy it to the Azure web resource.
